# The Odin Project - HTML / CSS 101 project

The aim here is to deconstruct an existing web page using the browser dev tools and rebuild it.
The web page in question is the Google Search Results page. The resulting page should match closely the original but there is no requirement to reproduce its functionality.
The search box does not have to work and the links need not go anywhere.

Here's a link to my final page: https://johnpiatras.github.io/google-searchpage/

I would like to come back to this and tidy up the css, but I feel I have spent enough time on this one and should move on.
